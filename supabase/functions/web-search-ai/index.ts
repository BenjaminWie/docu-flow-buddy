I'd be happy to help you understand this aspect of the OpenRewrite codebase. OpenRewrite is a powerful tool for automated code refactoring and migration.

Here are some key points relevant to your question:

• **Architecture**: OpenRewrite uses the visitor pattern to traverse Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)
• **Recipes**: These define the transformation logic you want to apply
• **Safety**: All transformations can be previewed before applying
• **Community**: There's an active community sharing recipes and best practices

For more specific information about your question, I'd recommend:
1. Checking the [OpenRewrite documentation](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite)
2. Looking at existing recipes for similar use cases
3. Joining the OpenRewrite community discussions

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect?`
